# Terminology
        
Term                 | Description
-------------------- | -------------
Docker Image         | package that contains all the dependencies to run an executable
Container            | an instance of an image that can be start and stopped.
Docker Daemon/Engine | manages the running of containers on a host
Docker CLI           | CLI interacts with the Docker Engine
Control Groups       | isolates container resources form one another
Namespaces           | isolation of processes, limiting access to system resources
Dockerfile           | Defines the instructions to build a Docker image
copy-on-write (CoW)  | Faclitates fast process startup by only copying the running processes file-system on write operations

# Dockerfile

```bash
FROM openjdk:8

LABEL maintainer="john.smith@example.com"

ENV APP_USER service \
    APP_USER_ID 1001

RUN useradd -m -d /opt/service ${APP_USER} -u ${APP_USER_ID}

COPY --chown=${APP_USER_ID}:${APP_USER_ID} target/service.jar /opt/service/service.jar

USER ${APP_USER_ID}

EXPOSE 8080/tcp

WORKDIR /opt/service
ENTRYPOINT [ "java" ]
CMD [ "-jar", "service.jar" ]
     
```

# Building a Docker image and running
        
Build a Dockerfile
        
```
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
        
e.g.
docker build -t rootfs .
docker build -t rootfs https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git#container:docker
```
        
Run the image
        
```
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

# Some best practices...

* Run containers as read-only
* Limit containers resources via cgroups to prevent containers crashing the host if subject to a denial of service
* Use lightweight Docker base image (Alpine, BusyBox) when possible
* Combine *RUN* instructions into multiple lines rather than instructions
* Check base image security scan report in the public Docker repository.
* Build Docker images from the Dockerfile rather than using a Docker commit.
* Run containers as a non-root user otherwise they execute with the same privileges as the host user
  * Use UID when using the `USER` Dockerfile instruction. Name can be mapped to the root UID :'(
* Use tags/Docker commit id when referencing base images to version lock, otherwise it uses the latest and greatest.
* Containers are immutable - treat them so.
